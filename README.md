clean-app
=========

This branch is gonna be gnarly for a bit, but I'm starting to get how I need to structure this as an ongoing development via GitHub. I'm making the clean-app to be used by a specific company, so there's some side-dev going on that won't be online. The UI guts will mostly remain open source and I'll keep some kind of a dummy backend around.

My intention is this master branch be used as an example of appIzer in action and to keep track of how this evolves from a very early point. Check the wiki
